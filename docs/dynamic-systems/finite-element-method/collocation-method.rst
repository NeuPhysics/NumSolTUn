Collocation Method
===================


This method is named collocation method because it employs two sets of basis functions.


To be specific, the result function should be

.. math::
   \psi = \psi(x_0) + \sum_i U_i H_i(x) + \sum_i U'_i S_i(x),

where :math:`\psi(x_0)` takes care of the boundary condition at :math:`x_0`.

With two set of basis functions the matrix form of the equation is double sized.
