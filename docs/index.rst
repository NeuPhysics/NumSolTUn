Computational Methods
==========================================================


This project is an extension of `NeuPhysics <http://neutrino.xyz>`_ by Lei Ma. The original project `neutrino physics notes <http://docs.neutrino.xyz>`_ is meant for the theoretical part of neutrino physics. However, as the research goes on, numerical method proves its importance. Hence I set up this project to record notes on the computational methods. Meanwhile, I am aware that the industry has gone a long way to manage and process data which is becoming the core of all industries. Hence I extend this notebook to a general purpose one.
